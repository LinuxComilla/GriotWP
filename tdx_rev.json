Its walls would have been dark and unornamented, in stark contrast to the elaborately carved stone temple exterior. The video behind the sculpture shows some of these facades, along with the musical accompaniment of traditional south Indian instruments, evoking the religious pilgrim’s sensory experience when encountering the divine.  The devotee’s chief objective in visiting the temple is to “see” the god through religious ritual. In exchange for a donation, the Brahmin priest performs a ceremony that summons the god into the icon.  In this structured exchange, the god looks out and beholds the devotee, who in turn looks back at him in a reciprocal exchange of gazes and prayer.

Like much of his art, Blind Man's Buff is allusive and symbolic, inviting explication yet resisting explicit interpretation. Yet, the artist's use of the three-paneled format that was traditional to Medieval and Renaissance altarpieces evokes religious associations. Beckmann also drew upon classical sources, calling the figures at center \"the gods\" and the animal-headed man the \"minotaur.\" Throughout the triptych, figures engage in sensual pleasures in a place where time, represented by a clock without XII or I, has no beginning or end. In sharp contrast on each wing are the blindfolded man and kneeling woman who, like prayerful donors in a Renaissance altarpiece, turn their backs to the confusion behind them.\r\nThis triptych was recently conserved in a four-month long exhibition, \"Restoring a Masterwork III: Max Beckmann's Blind Man's Buff,\" during which time the conservator treated the work under the watchful gaze of the public.

This painting became the model for countless deathbed scenes for two centuries to come, particularly for Neoclassical art around 1800. Many powerful human themes figure here: death, suffering, injustice, grief, loyalty, and revenge.\r\nPoussin drew on Roman antiquity for the form as well as the subject of this painting.

Here he depicted lush green pastures, a flock of grazing sheep, a lone shepherd, a man driving a farm cart, a row of thatched houses, and some trees and fences.\r\n\r\nAfter achieving reasonable success in Paris exhibiting controversial large-scale paintings of peasants at the Salons, Millet moved his growing family to the hamlet of Barbizon, joining an informal artists’ colony whose members were drawn to the forest of Fontainebleau and its surroundings. Up the road\r\nwas the village of Chailly-en-Bière, where people from the region traveled to be baptized, attend school, shop for food, and mail a letter. The bold technique of this pastel displays Millet’s remarkable originality, later admired by the Impressionists; the rigorous spatial structure reveals his firm academic training. Luminous touches of bright green, yellow, and pink create the effect of reflected light while a complex variety of strokes mimic the textures of the landscape—grass, dirt, shrubs, hay, bark, and mist.","title":"The Church at Chailly"},"images":[{"file":"120224_mia335_0371.tif","approved":false},{"file":"120224_mia335_0372.tif","approved":false},{"file":"120224_mia335_0373.tif","approved":false},{"file":"mia_6001565.tif","approved":false}]},"1704":{"meta":{"accession_number":"69.132","artist":"Frank Stella","continent":"North America","country":"United States","creditline":"Gift of Bruce B.

Eighteenth-century artists sometimes portrayed people as mythological characters to highlight their virtues. Girodet inverted this convention to defame Miss Lange. Danae was one of the mortals loved by the Greek god Zeus, who transformed himself into a shower of gold and fell upon her. Girodet shows Miss Lange greedily catching the gold coins. All of the painting's details are scathingly symbolic. For example, the turkey wearing a wedding ring represents a man the actress married for his fortune.

In the end, 26 of the participants composed 37 poems. Wang Xizhi was asked to write an introduction to the collection of these poems. Written in semi-cursive script and known as <I>Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion<I> (transcribed on the top of the mountain by the Qianlong Emperor), it is the best known and most copied calligraphic work in art history.

Wiley’s paintings transpose black bodies into the context of traditional European portraiture, challenging the racial marginalization of art history and questioning issues related to identity and self on a global scale. \r\n \r\nSantos-Dumont is part of a larger body of work by Wiley called “The World Stage.” For this series, the artist traveled to diverse locations around the globe, including Africa, China, India, and Brazil, where he created portraits that explore the international phenomenon of urban youth culture. Wiley met the two young men featured in this painting in a favela, or slum, in Rio de Janeiro. The subjects chose to position themselves as the two “fallen heroes” in a well-known public monument dedicated to one of Brazil’s pioneer aviators, Alberto Santos-Dumont. By depicting these black men as the pioneers of Brazilian aviation, Wiley instills his anonymous subjects with a powerful and heroic identity, essentially immortalizing them in oil paint.

The mural-size print was unprecedented in scale when it was published in the year 1500. Every building, canal, and open square is documented here. One imagines Barbari and his assistants climbing up the city's 103 bell towers in order to survey the dense urban landscape. The View of Venice also features the maritime activities that made the city an international center of trade. Mercury, the god of commerce, presides over the city, while watchful Neptune, god of the seas, rides his dolphin through the harbor.  \r\n\r\nThe incredible advance in the presentation and dissemination of information makes this the Google Earth of its day. The View is a landmark in the history of printmaking. It was printed in sections from six carved wooden blocks.

Wearing a beautifully decorated coat while hunting appeased the caribou and the Lord of the Caribou would release more animals for the people. Its shape was modeled on a <i>justaucorps</i>, a long knee-length coat worn by the French in the 17th and 18th centuries.  The motifs on this coat were dreamed by the hunter and given to his wife to interpret and paint. His dream was usually only two designs, the rest of the designs were of her artistic creation. The success of the hunt depended on the skill and artistry of the coat's creator. \r\nA triangle-shaped piece of hide on the lower portion of the back of the coat was removed and replaced with an identical piece. This piece is not a gusset to add flair to the garment, but the symbolic center of the coat, which represents the sacred mountain, the origin of the caribou.

Using a scraper, he set about the onerous task of effacing the beautiful crowd scene that had animated the foreground. He also retouched many of the figures remaining in the image, most tellingly that of Christ, whom he transformed from the apparition of the Holy Ghost to sinew and bone, a very physical man. He replaced the ground upon which the crowd had stood with a pit, a bottomless opening leading to hell. Now we stand on one side, Christ on the other, and we viewers become the crowd that must answer Pilate's entreaty to choose between Christ and Barrabas.\r\n \r\nRembrandt's highly structured composition imparts a sense of inevitability to the decision. The artist's sorrow for all involved seems to be reflected in his inclusion of a melancholic river god who mourns the event.

In his superb paintings, drawings, engravings and woodcuts, he still excites the eye and draws the viewer into his rich world of narrative. According to his early biographer Karel van Mander, Lucas would have been just 16 years old when he produced this image. Even if Lucas was not quite that young, we see him creating one of the most complex and subtle engravings ever made at that time.\r\n\r\nLucas sets the scene amid a grand architectural complex of palaces and towers flanking an elevated plaza that serves as a stage. A boisterous crowd gathers as Pontius Pilate invites them to determine the fate of Christ who is bound at the wrists and wears the crown of thorns and the mantle that his tormenters placed on his shoulders. As Pontius Pilate proclaims, \"Ecce homo\" (Behold the man), people gathered at windows and parapets of the surrounding buildings look on impassively.\r\n\t\r\nDetails of courtly and military costume, Netherlandish renaissance architecture, and mountainous landscape invite our eyes to roam through this microcosm. The range of lighting effects within the image as well as the minute description are so skillfully executed that, in this era, Albrecht Dürer was the only other artist capable of such feats of engraving.

He said he felt as if he were living in someone else's body and didn't know what to do with the stranger's hands and feet.

Instead, he used his sense of disorientation to create artworks that forge a richly expressive link between historical and contemporary concepts of culture, identity, and politics.\r\n\r\nBased on a coat of traditional Asian armor, this sculpture is composed from thousands of polished military dog tags. As the title indicates, the work juxtaposes the collective-represented by the armored sculpture-and the individual-symbolized by the dog tags, each representing a single soldier.

Shomei Tomatsu, the most important and influential photographer of post-war Japan, has photographed a watch that survived the destruction of the atomic bomb, which killed an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people, most of whom were civilians. On display at the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, the watch remains forever frozen at the exact moment that “Fat Man” incinerated the city. \r\n \r\nTomatsu has removed the watch from any visual context, and it appears to exist in a dream world void of time and space.
